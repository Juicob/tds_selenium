# tds_selenium
First run through of web scraping using selenium

[Here is a link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r_654iyFc1qrEOsqrlpLpflqHceijg3/view?usp=sharing) to a video walkthrough we recorded as a brief overview of how to use selenium on the Towards Data Science website. Initially tried pushing the .mp4 to the repo but the file was too large and didn't want to worry about installing git lfs and having others worry about it too. The link is just an open link from my google drive available for your reference and my embarrassment. Enjoy! 

Ideally I'd like to use this as a small exercise in git in regards to updating this file and potentially merging work from others so we can understand that workflow better.

Also, I don't know what to put in here to advise y'all to scrape responsibly, but yea. Be considerate and scrape responsibly.
